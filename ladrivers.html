			<p>Iconographic Los Angeles drivers manual for non-english speaking foreigners.
		 	Language can sometimes be a barrier if you are traveling to other countries. What I noticed when I moved to Los Angeles is that people here have completely different driving styles and a distinct set of rules. For an international audience this can be difficult to understand and result in confusion. The drivers guide is specifically designed with icons that should make reading easier. Icons are generally easier to understand and don’t require the reader to know a certain language. The manual is entirely pictorial. It is split in 3 categories: the don’ts, what you should watch out for and general rules. The poster that comes with the book explains each symbol that was used in the drivers manual.
