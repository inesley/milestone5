		<p>Fictional country branding. Here is a made-up history of Benevolentia:
		The growing inequality in our world has become a pressing issue of modern life and is becoming a threat not only for our economy, but also for our social life and future generations. Our goal was to aim towards a place of total balance and a world where all humans, male or female are equal. In 2020, a group of free spirited people decided that it was time for this change. To accomplish this they sought eligible leaders with specific qualities. Only a person who could fit the criteria was considered for this leader position. Here are the characteristics that a leader had to possess: be of young age, be respectful towards all other creatures living on earth, possess a peaceful mind, be aware of the resources mother nature gives you as a gift,  strive towards preservation of our planet, be physically & mentally strong. There had to be an even amount of female and male individuals in the leader positions. Once they were selected for these positions, it was in their hands to find a remote place where Earth’s resources have been untouched by the human race; a place that is in it’s purest state possible. The leaders gathered in Papua New Guinea to start a new world that they called Benevolentia. The leaders then went back to society and searched for people that were striving for a change and eager to learn, and bring them back to Benevolentia. It was for their own good to leave the rest of society behind. Once this was accomplished, it was the leaders responsibility to reproduce, then educate the future generations on the rules of Benevolentia. Their goal was to reverse society and their lifestyle  to its original state and a simpler way of life.
